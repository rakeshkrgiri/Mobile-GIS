<font size=5,>Mobile Platform</font></h1></center>
<p style="color:#186A3B;">The mobile platform is the combination of the hardware architecture of the mobile
device and its operating system, both of them are the base of the mobile GIS that is
installed and used on this platform.</p>

<p style="color:#186A3B;">The mobile device has specific and unique characteristics, first it belongs to a single and
unique person, it is a user identifiable device and two persons do not share the same
mobile device such as desktops and land line telephones. Second, it is always-on
wearable device. Third, the most used device all over the world, almost each adult holds
one (Mateos and Fisher 2006). Mobile phone is considered the seventh mass media as smartphone, PDA, intelligent device, handheld navigator and others.
The mobile device is a multi-objective equipment, with fundamental characteristics of
small size and GSM connectivity, in addition to modern accessories such as digital
camera, video recording, sound recording, GPS, A-GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IrDA, FM
receiver and transmitter, keypad (mobile phone or qwerty), processor, RAM, hard disk,
and a small (touch) screen (2 – 3.5 inch). The mobile device is a cellular phone,
executes computer programs, and connects to the internet and/or mobile/computer
devices. The mobile device moves on earth, on water, on air, can be used indoor or
outdoor.
The mobile device as all other hardware devices witnessed exponential development
triggered by high demand at the global level and endless user requirements. It has the
three main hardware components of the classic Personal Computer (PC) which are
processor, RAM, and storage, in addition to other hardware peripherals and accessories.
The trend in hardware development for the last 30 years was in one direction cheaper
price, better performance, and smaller in size (Bossler et al. 2005). The nanotechnology
play a major role in leading the hardware industry in its direction.<br><center>
