<font size=5,>What Is Mobile GIS?</font></h1>
<p style="color:#186A3B;">Mobile GIS is taking Geographic Information Systems (GIS) out of the office and into the field.
 A mobile GIS allows folks out in the field to capture, store, update, manipulate, analyze, and display geospatial data and information. 
Mobile GIS integrates one or more of the following technologies:
<br>* mobile devices (such as a PDA, tablet, or laptop computer, and in some countries mobile phones) 
<br>* Geographic Information System (GIS) software<br>
* the Global Positioning System (GPS) <br>
* wireless communications for Internet-based GIS access. For most applications, it is an extension of desktop GIS, although increasingly users are taking mobile GIS data and uploading it directly to powerful visualization tools online such as Google Earth. <br>
Mobile GIS can allow for edits and changes to be made in the field, increasing accuracy and saving time. Many mobile GIS systems are relatively inexpensive

<font size=5,>Aims Of Study?</font></h2>
<p style="color:blue;">The mobile GIS is a new paradigm in Geography and it has the power not only to
deliver the geospatial data to the mobile user everywhere and anytime, but also it
personalizes the geographical data and enables the capture of the geographical
dimension of the personal information and the ease interaction with geographic
coordinates.
The standalone framework is proposed to enable the full functionality of mobile GIS
with complete independence, the intelligent landmark is a new system for the
capture of the relative position of the mobile user in realtime, and metric geographic
minute is a proposed geographic coordinate for the ease of use of geographic
coordinates

<font size=5,>Objectives Of Mobile GIS</font></h3>
<p style="color:brown;">Fully Open Source<br>
Compaitiability with a large varietyof mobile devices(PDA,Tablets,Cell Phone etc.)<br>
Multi language support<br>
support vector,raster and various database formats<br>
integration of GPS
