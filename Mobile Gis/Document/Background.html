<font size=5,>Evolution Of Mobile GIS</font></h1>
<p style="color:#186A3B;">The mobile GIS is in the core of the ICT revolution. The mobile users are moving in a
geographic space and they know their positions and they have access to the wide
available geographical data and information. It is essential requirement to exploit these
tools online for spatial decision support and for movement management and operations.
The main objective of the mobile GIS is to minimize the time and energy of navigation
and movement and make them more efficient.
Several reasons motivated the mobility computing in general and mobile GIS in
particular. First, the expansion of wireless communication, second the mobile networks
are everywhere worldwide, third the exponential advancement in hardware, and finally the availability of geographical databases. The revolution of the PC and internet was
dissolved in the mobility revolution that replaced it.
The figures and statistics about the mobile phone and ICT penetration provide a clear
vision about the mobility. At the end of 2009, the number of mobile cellular
subscriptions had reached around 4.6 billion out of world population of 6.8 billion, and
ITU (International Telecommunication Union) expects the number of mobile cellular
subscriptions to reach globally five billion in 2010.
The overall mobile cellular coverage reached 86% from urban and rural areas (ITU
2010). Internet users attained 1.8 billion in June 2010. <br>The number of worlddwide mobile cellular subscription doubled from 33.6 in 2005 to
67.8 per 100 inhabitants in 2009. In the same period, number of worldwide telephone
land lines dropped from 19.1 to 17.7 per 100 inhabitants <br>From the above information, over 65% from world population possess a mobile phone
and this is more than double the population with internet access and the number of land
line telephones is decreasing. The global smartphone shipments reached 54 million
units during Q1 2010, accounting for growing a huge 50% from 36 million in Q1 2009.

<font size=5,>Problem Of Mobile GIS</font></h1>
<p style="color:red;">The mobile GIS needs to access the geodatabases whatever public, private or special
and with the knowledge of its location, it needs to perform spatial analysis, acquires
geospatial knowledge, and obtains spatial decision support in realtime everywhere. As it
appears from the definition of mobile GIS problem, there are many limitations and
challenges need to be fully addressed for the success of mobile GIS. First, the position
of the mobile device and its accuracy and semantic (indoor or outdoor) has to be
determined. Second, the required geospatial data relevant to the user, and the geospatial
analysis tools needed to achieve user requirements have to be available on the mobile
platform. Third, the geovisualization of the data to a user, who is not aware about
cartographic science and needs data to comply with his mind understanding about
location, has to be presented on the mobile screen.
