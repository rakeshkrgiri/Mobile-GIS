<P>Chapter (1) introduced the study aims and objectives with a general overview. Chapter
(2) discussed the evolution of mobile GIS . The mobile GIS problem is presented and its current status and trends
were discussed
<br>
In chapter (3), the architecture of mobile GIS and its components were described<br>

<font size=5,>CONCLUSION</font></h2></center>
<br>
<p>The mobile GIS is evolving and is driving the science and technology to a new horizon.
The hardware of mobile device is developing at a higher rate than the development of
its operating systems, which require a new vision and design based on the exponential
development in hardware. The mobile device is rich in its communications capabilities
with the increasing bandwidth of present wireless networks, and it is a handy tool to
geospatially transfer knowledge online as it connects the owner of the knowledge to the
requester.<br>
The mobile GIS is an important tool in the acquisition of geospatial data, gathering its
attributes data, and collecting the trajectories of moving objects even by non-experts.
The acquisition of accurate 3D coordinates in realtime, the orthometric height, indoor
coordinates, and the discovery of surrounding location environment are challenges
facing mobile device and require more research. The lack of standard format for the
geospatial data is a challenge to the geospatial industry. For the mobile GIS, this
challenge requires also a compact format for vector, raster, and multimedia data.<br>
In final, the mobile GIS is on the priority of the research agenda of several scientific
disciplines within the geoinformation community, its user base is increasing
exponentially generating high demand on mobile GIS.
